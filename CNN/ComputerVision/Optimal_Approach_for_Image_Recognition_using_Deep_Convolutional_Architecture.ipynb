Selecting optimal architecture for specific problem is a challenging task, at a closing\nstage of the article we proposed optimal approach to deep convolutional\narchitecture for the application of image recognition.\n\n# Introduction \n\n> In any artificial intelligence problem we require two main things. First, we need\nto identify and extract right set of features that represent the problem. Second,\nwe need to have an algorithm that takes these extracted features and provides\npredicted outputs.\n\n\n# Literaturre Review \n\n> LeNet consist of 5 convolution layers for feature extraction and object detection.\n\n\n\n\nAppunto \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
