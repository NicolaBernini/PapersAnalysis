# Overview 

You can see this repo as a consolidation of reading groups which I do between me and myself :) 

## Why this repo 

Keeping the pace of current Deep Learning Research is almost impossible and even focusing on a specific field, like Computer Vision, is extremely hard because of the new papers rate (which by the way I think it is a great thing, it makes us living in exciting times), their hard to understand content and the fact code is not so often accompanying the paper 

This is specifically true if you are student as, in my opinion, the gap between the educational material (books, courses, ...) and the research material today is quite big. 

The goal of this repo is to try helping students to make the *quantum leap* to get from the students side to the researchers side with the following methodology 
- Selecting relevant or interesting papers 
- Providing papers summaries 
- Adding code snippets implementing specific parts 
- Diving a bit more into theory and math when necessary (research papers tend to be vague on this kind of things)



## How to CONTRIBUTE 

As explained in [Contribute.md](contribute.md) contribution are absolutely welcome 

- Open issues to 
  - **bugfix**: notify me about bugs, typos, ... 
  - **features**: suggest relevant papers, discuss content, ... 

- Submit PR with new summaries, implementations, ... 

Feel free to DM me on [Twitter at @NicolaBernini](https://twitter.com/NicolaBernini) to discuss anything 



## How to View the content 

The content is typically Markdown because it is very light but as you know GitHub does not support server side math rendering so I suggest to use some Browser Plugin like
