# Overview 

## Why this repo 

Keeping the pace of current Deep Learning Research is almost impossible and even focusing on a specific field, like Computer Vision, is extremely hard because of the new papers rate (which by the way I think it is a great thing, it makes us living in exciting times), their hard to understand content and the fact code is not so often accompanying the paper 

This is specifically true if you are student as, in my opinion, the gap between the educational material (books, courses, ...) and the research material today is quite big. 

The goal of this repo is to try helping students to make the *quantum leap* to get from the students side to the researchers side with the following methodology 
- Selecting relevant or interesting papers 
- Providing papers summaries 
- Adding code snippets implementing specific parts 
- Diving a bit more into theory and math when necessary (research papers tend to be vague on this kind of things)
