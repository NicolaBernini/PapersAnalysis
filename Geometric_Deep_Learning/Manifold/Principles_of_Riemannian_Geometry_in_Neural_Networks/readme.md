# Summary 

## Problem: Why this paper 

Solution 

- Trying to develop a theory of Deep Learning in a Math Framework 



## Problem: How to start such a development of a theory 

Solution 

- Start by restricting to specific cases: this paper regards Feed Forward Neural Networks 



## Problem: How to represent data in the framework of Geometry 

Solution 

- Represent data as points lying on a Manifold 



## Problem: How to represent Neural Network in the Framework of Geometry 

Solution 

- Represent Neural Network as learnable functions performing coordinate system transformation on the Data Manifold 



## Problem: How to define connections between the world of NN and the work of geomtry 

Solution 

- Find analogies 



## Problem: Find Analogies for Ordinary NN 

Solution 

- Statical Systems 

- TBD 



## Problem: Find Analogies for Residual Networks 

Solution 

- Dynamical Systems, modelled with First Order Differential Equations
