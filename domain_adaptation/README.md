### What is Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)

- The Unsupervised Domain Adaptation is a form of Transfer Learning consisting of transferring a capability, for example classification, from the domain where this capability has been acquired to another domain 
- The term unsupervised means that it is assumed no labels are available in the target domain, only data 


### Why UDA

- Currently, Deep Learning Models have been successful a variety of tasks with very high-level performance but these results have been achieved not just thanks to the model itself but also thanks to 
  - a huge amount of data 
  - annotations 

- Supervised Learning Paradigm has a bottleneck related to the availability of labels hence all the techniques that can help to mitigate this issue, including UDA, are considered very useful now
